I asked him to ship first, because he did not have any trade rep yet. He told me 3 separate times that he had my beer in hand, followed by a text the next day stating that he didn't actually have it, and that he'd be picking it up that day. When he finally did send me the photo of it, it took him nearly 2 weeks to actually get it packed up and shipped out, and provide me a tracking number. All in all, from initial contact to receipt of my package, it took 4 weeks. His communication was poor, he never initiated any messages about what the status of my trade was or giving me tracking info. Because of all of this, I won't be trading with him again.",,

My only gripe is that his packaging left a lot to be desired. One of the extra bottles leaked a bit, but the beer was still drinkable. It's a wonder the glass didn't break and the cans didn't explode, though. Very minimal use of bubble wrap and things weren't snug at all. To the extent that there was enough packaging to swim through, the beer had all swam its way to the bottom of the box--pretty much direct beer-to-pavement contact when the box was sitting on my porch.

7/13/2014 16:14:10,JohnChamp,mmarks111,"Third successful trade.  Redditor contacted me with a 3Floyds trade.  I traded him a beer I had yet to try, Mud & Funk and other beers.  I feel terrible, as the day before it arrived in Indiana, I had it in a tasting in Los Angeles.  It was flat and horrible.  I warned him, and told him, although HE chose the beers for trade, I would replace it with a comparable beer.  Either way, redditor and I are in good standing, he appreciates everything and we're setting up another trade.  Seems to be the norm around here.

- John",,
7/13/2014 16:17:47,JohnChamp,nolewag,"Fourth successful trade, and the best experience thus far.  Not necessary the best beer, but the redditor is extremely nice, helpful, and included a Cigar City Brewery 50 Caliber bottle opener as an extra.  Might not sound like much, but I dont believe I got any extra with the first 2 trades, and the 3rd trade with 1 extra bottle.  That is not a problem.  I include an extra/extras every time.  It seems like good policy. But he included extra beer and this very cool bottle opener.  Overall, the best trade thus far.  4th successful trade, and already gathering more beer for a trade in a few weeks.

Very generous on his behalf (in my book), but perhaps it was equally fair on both sides.  Either way, the redditor included an extra of HT, which is extremely nice for a California boy whos only had a half can in his short craft beer lifespan.  Another successful trade.  Hopefully he and I can continue trading.

The IPAs basically tasted like a Barleywine. Hop aroma was gone. All malt with weird hop bitterness. I had a fresh version of the Gose after receiving his package and noticed the Gose he sent me had diminished in flavor. Obviously, Karamchandani did not attempt to find me the freshest possible versions of these beers and/or did not test quality prior to shipping.

I notified him about the IPAs specifically. I understand that there may have been a fluke with the Westbrook IPA but he sent me an old Citrus Ninja Exchange (about 2 months old). Every knowledgeable beer lover understands the importance of drinking IPAs fresh. He showed ignorance on the subject when he responded with, ""It shouldn't taste like that considering it was bottled around July/early-August.""

He hasn't shown any sign of understanding. I will not trade with him again.",,

1/14/2015 8:44:52,EXccord,mdr008uark,Organized a meet-up trade as I was going to be in St. Louis for the holidays as a nice getaway.  The bottles I had wanted were a limited release requiring tickets to be purchased on-site.  We first communicated through the posting I submitted (http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/2plw0p/request_st_louis_mo_4_hands_madagascar_details/) and then moved to texting.  I picked up some goodies for him to take with me and brought all of them along for the trip.  We communicated at least once every day just chatting up about different beers and whatnot from around the area as well as mine.  We both met up at 4 Hands Brewery on the release day (28th I believe) and exchanged our goodies.  We tried to set up a trade that was as even as possible.  I am definitely hoping to do some trading in the future with him as he is a top notch guy who helped me out tremendously on this trade.  I hope any and all future tradings are as smooth as they were with him.  ,,

We decided on ~$30 for ~$30, I asked him if a BBPT5 + Mocha Abduction was in that range, he never really answer. From what I gather, I got screwed out of $10ish of beer--$14ish for the MA and BBPT5 is about the same price per 4-pack as BCBS. Maybe the rarity factor offsets this, but we decided up front to go $4$. I won't trade with this guy again.

So I get his package and it's just the 2 six packs. And if they weren't cans I wouldn't be surprised if every single bottle was smashed, that's how poorly it was packed.

I let him know what happened, and he said he'd replace it with something else (we did a locals for locals trade, so I didnt have much of a preference aside from it beong a fresh hoppy beer). He sent a new box out which was packed to resist a tornado (beers inside a buclet, sealed with tape, and stuffed I to a box). Instead of just sending a shelf replacement, he surprised me with a top want brewery only beer (beachwood melrose), along with a modern times coffee blackhouse, a full six pack of a mother earth ipa, modern times oneida can, and a bottle of boulevard hibiscus gose. Stuff like this isn't mentioned/done enough on beertrade, and I would like for his action to be recognized.

Wasn't sure where I needed to report this. I sent all of my end and he sent only half and promised to send the second half soon after and never did. Now he is avoiding my messages or claiming he will send and never gets around to it. I sent my package the first week of August and did receive anything from him until August 17. After that, very little communication and no beer. On my end it was: JK Black Metal, 2x bishop barrel 9, 2x bishop barrel 10, JK Commercial Suicide, Prairie Brett C. He promised 3 De Garde beers and a Cascade sour of his choice. Only got two de garde's and it dropped off from there. I did have one bishop barrel break in transit and was going to send a replacement of some form on our next trade as we agreed upon, but then he vanished. Kept giving sketchy excuses like he was at a 5 day festival, or took a 3 week trip somewhere. It has now been two months and I am without all the beer I was promised. ",,
