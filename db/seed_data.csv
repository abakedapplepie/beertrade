CptnKickass,Dutchangle,11/20/2013,"While he did follow through and complete his end of the trade, I won't be trading with him again. It felt like pulling teeth. I asked him to ship first, because he did not have any trade rep yet. He told me 3 separate times that he had my beer in hand, followed by a text the next day stating that he didn't actually have it, and that he'd be picking it up that day. When he finally did send me the photo of it, it took him nearly 2 weeks to actually get it packed up and shipped out, and provide me a tracking number. All in all, from initial contact to receipt of my package, it took 4 weeks. His communication was poor, he never initiated any messages about what the status of my trade was or giving me tracking info. Because of all of this, I won't be trading with him again."

While I appreciate the prompt shipping and the nice extras, the Overrated is from mid-October (over three months old).  I threw it out.  The canning date is conspicuously displayed on the bottom of the can, so there really is no excuse to send that shit through the mail.  It's so oxidized I can't even give it away.  Overall, I must admit that I'm pretty disappointed, though the Hopalicious and the Furious were excellent."

I shipped on schedule then a day or two later he messaged me saying he was packing my box. He didn't get to ship until Friday (told him before I'd prefer shipping on Mondays) and I just got his box yesterday.

He sent me back my own box which tells me he lied about packing on that day lol.

Either way we both got what we wanted safely, just probably won't conduct another trade with him simply due to preference. All on me that I didn't clarify enough with a newer trader."

CrzzyLegz,colinwehrle,5/9/2014,"Setup a trade for Dark Lord a while ago. While I greatly appreciate him sending me one of his Dark Lords I was also pretty bummed about this trade. I sent first and he agreed to send too and said he was taking it to ship it off, and then after I had told him I shipped he dropped the ""I'm going to wait until yours arrives first"" Ok, so that's fine. Not only did I tell him I would add extras but he got my package in first and got he got a very nice package. He sent his via USPS which was another knock on him. I finally got his package and its just the one beer. Just bummed out that I setup a great package for him, told him, he got it first, and he took forever to get me the bare minimum. Will NOT be trading with him again. At least I got the beer I wanted though, trade is technically complete and all good."

This trade was in person and apparently he thought I'd be bringing half a case of '12 bcbs for his 3 bottles....I feel taken at the very least but this is a good refresher to send a heads up EXACTLY what I will be bringing and EXACTLY what I expect to receive.

Said he'd done 6 or 7 trades on Reddit, but his username didn't show up on the reputation list. Was 100% fine with shipping first. 

My only gripe is that his packaging left a lot to be desired. One of the extra bottles leaked a bit, but the beer was still drinkable. It's a wonder the glass didn't break and the cans didn't explode, though. Very minimal use of bubble wrap and things weren't snug at all. To the extent that there was enough packaging to swim through, the beer had all swam its way to the bottom of the box--pretty much direct beer-to-pavement contact when the box was sitting on my porch.

Nevertheless, I'd trade again with this dude in a heartbeat."

Either way, the redditor included an extra of HT, which is extremely nice for a California boy whos only had a half can in his short craft beer lifespan.  Another successful trade.  Hopefully he and I can continue trading.

I recieved the box and boy did he more than make up for the miss communication. threw 2 Bruery beers in plus a couple other extras too. this mad deserves flair for how awesome he is when he accidentally messes up.

I was on a deadline as some of these beers were supposed to be a gift, and I expressed this to Syn4com.  He ended up shipping the wrong package to me, recalled the night before expected delivery, and then had to change the trade because he didn't have one of the beers he promised me.  The 2nd shipment got stalled at the shipment center for some reason, but Syn4com called and got it cleared up.  Eventually the beers arrived safely, with some extras.  It was after the deadline I needed, but it's OK, I'll enjoy the beers myself and I had backups for my gift giving. "

Told him I was thoroughly disappointed, he said he would send an appreciation box for the extras, but I doubt it.  Unless I do, this guy is officially off my wanting-to-trade-with-again list.

wizarsteve,karamchandani,10/14/2014,"I traded 3 Modern Times Beers (2 Fortunate Islands and 1 Lomaland) & a Sour in the Rye by the Bruery. He gave me a 6-pack of Westbrook Gose (Bottled 8/6/14), Westbrook IPA (bottled 9/11/14) and a Westbrook Citrus Ninja Exchange (bottled 8/14/14). I received the package on the 6th of October. The IPAs basically tasted like a Barleywine. Hop aroma was gone. All malt with weird hop bitterness. I had a fresh version of the Gose after receiving his package and noticed the Gose he sent me had diminished in flavor. Obviously, Karamchandani did not attempt to find me the freshest possible versions of these beers and/or did not test quality prior to shipping.

I notified him about the IPAs specifically. I understand that there may have been a fluke with the Westbrook IPA but he sent me an old Citrus Ninja Exchange (about 2 months old). Every knowledgeable beer lover understands the importance of drinking IPAs fresh. He showed ignorance on the subject when he responded with, ""It shouldn't taste like that considering it was bottled around July/early-August.""

He hasn't shown any sign of understanding. I will not trade with him again."

We each had tickets purchased through Ticketmaster and had to transfer ownership of our tickets without knowing that the other would reciprocate, but everything went perfectly. I know this isn't technically a beer trade, but maybe it could count as a good trade.

amper,chongcheesol,10/28/2014,"I responded to chongcheesol's request for Alpine Ichabod.

In chatting with him and quickly getting along, we suggested expanding our trade to include some CCB standards (Jai Alai, Cubano Espresso, an Experimental Hop, and Big Sound) on his end and I responded by putting together a set of Alpine (Ichabod, Nelson, Duet) as well as AleSmith Speedway and two other stouts to his preference.

He was extremely quick to respond and eager to let me know of any fresh releases.

As a result of the positive experience, I believe we will both be trading partners again in the future. "

ATLBeerTrade,lskennedy,1/23/2015,"Sent him 5 Bomb! for a BBPT5 and a Mocha Abduction. Smooth trade, but I wish I'd been a bit more aware. We decided on ~$30 for ~$30, I asked him if a BBPT5 + Mocha Abduction was in that range, he never really answer. From what I gather, I got screwed out of $10ish of beer--$14ish for the MA and BBPT5 is about the same price per 4-pack as BCBS. Maybe the rarity factor offsets this, but we decided up front to go $4$. I won't trade with this guy again. Even if we simply miscommunicated, an honest trader would have said, ""hey, my side is coming out pretty far ahead here--what else do you want?"""

ccoch,007WillyWoo,4/4/2015,"This trade was basically even $4$. I was sending 2 bombers and he's seeing 2 sixers. And since we were both shipping cross country the dude asked me to throw in something extra. I had already packed up my box and included an extra 12 oz beer just out of generosity. So I get his package and it's just the 2 six packs. And if they weren't cans I wouldn't be surprised if every single bottle was smashed, that's how poorly it was packed. I was just surprised that I was asked to throw in an extra if it wasn't going to be reciprocated. No big deal though, what we agreed upon was there.
"
GUI_Center,Fr0gking,4/4/2015,"Fill with mingled cream and amber,
I will drain that glass again.
Such hilarious visions clamber
Through the chamber of my brain.
Quaintest thoughts, queerest fancies
Come to life and fade away.
What care I how time advances;
I am drinking ale today.

maxocircus,jacobnoah360,5/11/2015,"Communication from /u/jacobnoah was sporadic and unclear.  I said 2 of each and he assumed 2 4-packs of each, when I really meant cans.  He kept offering more beer like, are you sure you aren't interested in this other thing?  I said no because I thought our trade was fair as it stood.  He should have said something clear like, I think you are offering too much. ($72 worth of cans for 1 Parabola is what he was thinking.  I was thinking 4 cans total at $18 for the Parabola.)  This was an IP trade and we eventually settled somewhere in the middle.  But in retrospect, I do not think the price he quoted for the Parabola was fair.  Overall, not a pleasant experience and I would not trade with this trader again."

Maybe because it was only 1 bottle and a few cans it wasnt at as much risk but I'm chalking this one up to luck.

I let him know what happened, and he said he'd replace it with something else (we did a locals for locals trade, so I didnt have much of a preference aside from it beong a fresh hoppy beer). He sent a new box out which was packed to resist a tornado (beers inside a buclet, sealed with tape, and stuffed I to a box). Instead of just sending a shelf replacement, he surprised me with a top want brewery only beer (beachwood melrose), along with a modern times coffee blackhouse, a full six pack of a mother earth ipa, modern times oneida can, and a bottle of boulevard hibiscus gose. Stuff like this isn't mentioned/done enough on beertrade, and I would like for his action to be recognized. This is a brand new member of our community, and it is a great thing to see around here especially with all the bad traders that have been popping up recently. I nominate Scgt86 for a trade warrior flair, as he is more than worthy of it."

Klink82 received 2 month old Pliny, as opposed to 1 month old Pliny as a result, and we share responsibility for the outcome. That aside, Klink82 was my first trade, and shipped as soon as my package arrived, true to his word. The bottles inside all arrived tenderly wrapped in newspaper and nested into the bottle carrier - no damage on arrival. And excellent beers, too. Klink82 said he was going to be less generous with the extra bottles he had discretion over as a result of the Pliny's sub-optimal freshness, but these all look exquisite to me, and fine choices."
