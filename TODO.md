* A concept of bad traders
* something in the trade listing query isn't indexed
* send a message when somebody accepts a trade
* have it delay feedback until both sides complete
* glyphicons for shipping and maybe other statuses
* add a way to get from feedback back to the trade and a way to see the participants on the trade itself
* missing some test coverage and some pending tests
