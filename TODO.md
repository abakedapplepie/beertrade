* when requesting a trade, show a message if they don't have any trades, a yellow message if they have neutral feedback and a red message if they have negative
* notifications are super ugly
* send a message when somebody accepts a trade
* have it delay feedback until both sides complete
* glyphicons for shipping and maybe other statuses
* add a way to get from feedback back to the trade and a way to see the participants on the trade itself
* missing some test coverage and some pending tests
